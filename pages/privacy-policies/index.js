        This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you may provide on the codelength.net website ("Website" or "Service") and 
        any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services") is collected, protected and used. 
        It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information.
         This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you" or "your") and this Website operator ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our").
          By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. 
        This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.

              <h3 style={{color:'white',paddingTop:'20px',paddingBottom:'20px'}}>Automatic collection of information</h3>  

              Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy.
               We may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Website and Services.
                Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and 
                establish statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. 
              This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.

            <h3 style={{color:'white',paddingTop:'20px',paddingBottom:'20px'}}>Collection of personal information</h3>  

            You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific,
             identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address).
              We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content, or fill any online forms on the Website. 
            When required, this information may include personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
            <br/>
            Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website and Services. 
            However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases and our joint marketing partners.
             You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the Website.
             Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.

            <h3 style={{color:'white',paddingTop:'20px',paddingBottom:'20px'}}>Use and processing of collected information</h3>  
            In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:
               <br/>
               Create and manage user accounts
               <br/>
               Run and operate the Website and Services
Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies:
<br/>
 (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; 
 this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act
  or European data protection law;             <br/>
  (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
  <br/>
   (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject;
   <br/>
    (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us;
    <br/>
    (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
    <br/>
Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

        <h3 style={{color:'white',paddingTop:'20px',paddingBottom:'20px'}}>Managing information</h3>  

        You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Website and Services change.

We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties.

          <h3 style={{color:'white',paddingTop:'20px',paddingBottom:'20px'}}>Do Not Track signals</h3> 

          websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.

We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.
